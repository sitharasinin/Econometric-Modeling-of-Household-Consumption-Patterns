**Institution:** Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi

> A comparative study using advanced demand system models to analyze and contrast household spending patterns in two economically distinct Indian states.

### Summary

This project analyzes the consumption behavior of households in Haryana, a state with a high per capita income, and Chhattisgarh, a state with a lower-income, mineral-based economy.Using unit-level data from the **NSSO 64th Round (2007-08) Household Consumer Expenditure Survey**, the study employs two key econometric models—the **Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS)** and the **Linear Expenditure System (LES)**—to estimate income and price elasticities for various goods. The findings reveal significant structural differences in spending patterns, offering insights for designing state-specific policies aimed at improving welfare and fostering inclusive growth.

###  Key Research Question

How do household consumption patterns, income elasticities, and price elasticities differ between a high-income, diversified economy (Haryana) and a lower-income, mineral-based economy (Chhattisgarh)?

###  Methodology and Data

* **Data Source:** National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) 64th Round (2007-08) Household Consumer Expenditure Survey.
* **Econometric Models:**
  **Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS):** Used to estimate a flexible system of demand functions, satisfying key economic properties like additivity and homogeneity.
    * **Linear Expenditure System (LES):** Applied to model behavior where households first cover minimum subsistence needs before allocating surplus income, making it ideal for analyzing lower-income patterns.

###  Key Findings

* **Structural Differences Confirmed:** The analysis revealed significant structural differences in consumption behavior between the two states.
* **"Food Budget Squeeze":** In both states, expenditure on food is lower than on non-food items, reflecting a broader trend where rising incomes shift spending priorities. For the 64th round, food expenditure was 14% of total consumption in Haryana and 7.03% in Chhattisgarh.
* **Urbanization and Fuel:** Haryana, being more urbanized, showed lower sensitivity to fuel price changes compared to Chhattisgarh.
* **Necessities vs. Luxuries:** The models identified necessities and luxuries in each state. Notably, medical and education were classified as necessities in Haryana but as luxury items in Chhattisgarh, reflecting the differing development levels.

###  Technologies Used

The analysis for this project involved:
* **Software:** Statistical software for econometric analysis (e.g., R, Stata).
* **Tasks:** Advanced Econometric Modeling (AIDS & LES), Demand System Estimation, Elasticity Calculation, and Data Analysis with large-scale survey data.
